## FAQ

<details>
<summary> How can I use an envrionment variable as input</summary>
<p>

Using Environment variables directly as input arguments is not supported by GitHub Actions.
You can define an intermidiate step that outputs the desired value and use that value as the input

```yaml
- name: Get Image name
  id: image_name
  run: echo "##[set-output name=image;]$(echo $TEST_IMAGE_NAME)"
```

And then use it as input:

```sh
image: ${{steps.image_name.outputs.image}}
```
